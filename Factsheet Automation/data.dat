Kaiken
The Caiquén is a wild goose from Patagonia that flies across The Andes between Argentina and Chile. By embarking on this cross-border flight the Caiquén takes up a major challenge. Just like the Caiquén, Aurelio Montes, founder of the Chilean winery Bodega Montes, made several trips across the Andes until, in 2000 he rediscovered Mendoza as a generous land filled with superb vines and hardworking people. In 2001 he realized Mendoza was the perfect place to make Kaikén Wines, wines that embody everything a great wine ought to be.

Argentinian Malbec
Extremely popular, Argentinian Malbec is an inky, medium-bodied, dry red wine with strong impressions of dark fruits on the nose and palate. This wine tends to have mellower tannins than its French counterpart. Heavily dependent on where they are grown for variations in flavor, Argentinian Malbec has quickly become a world favorite due to the characteristics that the high altitude climate and soils impart to the fruit. Originally from France, it is one of the original 5 “Bordeaux” grapes. It is scarcely planted in France anymore. It has found an amazingly hospitable home in the mountains of Argentina from which some of the world's best selling Malbecs are grown. Starkly different from French versions in structure and flavor, this wine is a good investment for collectors, as the wine can age for several years before drinking.This wine also pairs very well with any savory red meat dish-- particularly dishes that include spice.

Yellow Tail
The family-owned winery is in the small country town of Yenda, Australia. This is where [yellow tail] wine is made by the sixth generation of the Casella family. In 1957 founders Filippo and Maria Casella migrated from Sicily and arrived on Australian shores. They began making wine with the family’s winemaking philosophy at its heart, to bring family and friends together at any occasion. It was this approach that inspired John Casella’s vision for [yellow tail] in 2001, to create an approachable wine that everyone could enjoy. By doing so, he wanted to demonstrate that wine could be fun, easy to choose, easy to drink and easy to understand. It is about making consistently great wines that over deliver on taste and quality, wines that are accessible and appealing to people all over the world. Today John Casella continues to run the family business using the same principle of creating great tasting wines for all to enjoy. By combining a passion and understanding of the Italian heritage with a relaxed and modern Australian attitude, Casella continues to create wines that have wide appeal and will be enjoyed for generations to come.

Australian Cabernet Sauvignon
The home of Cabernet Sauvignon is in Bordeaux. However, Australia has found great success growing it, especially in the regions of Coonawarra and Margaret River. These Cabs balance the dark, rich fruit that Cab is known for with flavors of mint and eucalyptus. With climates that are similar to France's Bordeaux, Australia has found success making Cabernet Sauvignon wines, especially the wines from Coonawarra in the South and Margaret River in the West. While it is often blended with the popular Shiraz grape, it can make lovely balanced wines on its own. The Cabs of Australia do not have quite as much richness or alcohol as Cabs from the Napa Valley, or the subtle complexity of the best Bordeauxs. They do, however, possess a beautiful balance of fruit, acidity and tannin. With all of these elements in harmony, these wines are delightful after a few years of aging.

Leo Hillinger
The Leo Hillinger winery in Jois was brought up to date after the son of the same name was taken over in 1990. The barriques used at the Leo Hillinger winery are made exclusively from French oak, which gives the wines their sweet, woody aromas. Each barrel is filled a maximum of twice in order to guarantee the maximum aromatic enrichment of the wines. In the vineyards, the grapes are only picked by hand so that only the ripe ones are selected. After the harvest, the grapes are selected - also by hand - and destemmed. The grape harvest begins around September. The Burgenland in Austria is characterized by a sunny and warm climate, whereby the sugar content of the grapes increases and full, intense grapes are formed, which is supported by the soil properties. About half of the Leo Hillinger wines are exported all over the world.

Austrian Zweigelt
The fruit-forward and spicy Zweigelt, with flavors of sour cherry, raspberry, cinnamon, violets and pepper, has soft tannins and is the most widely planted red grape in Austria. It can taste similar to a spicy Beaujolais, a racy Pinot Noir or an inky California Zinfandel. In 1922, Zweigelt was created by researcher Frank Zweigelt, by crossing an Austrian grape called Blaufränkish, which gives the wine its acidity, with St. Laurent, which imparts bright cherry flavors and a smooth texture.  Zweigelt is planted throughout Austria, with the most expressive wines coming from the Neusiedlersee DAC of Burgenland, in the easternmost part of country.  While most Zweigelt styles are dry, the grape is also used to make sweeter styles such as strohwein and ice wine.

Grüner Veltliner
Austrian Grüner Veltliner
Grüner Veltliner is the signature grape of Austria. Following strict fermentation and bottling standards, is it difficult to find a poorly made Grüner.  Very similar to Sauvignon Blanc, in many respects, Grüner Veltliner is a great alternative to explore, expressing nuances that will make your nose and palate crave more. Although hard to find, sparkling Grüner are exceptionally fun to try.  Dry, delicate, with a tingly finish, this wine imparts significant citrus flavors of lime, lemon, and grapefruit. Some Grüner also have a prevailing nectarine note as well. For non-fruits Grüner, you can expect white pepper, and slight bitterness of flavors of vegetables like radish.  If oaked, which not all are, you will taste and smell nut and cream. These wines do not have significant shelf life, and are best enjoyed within 2 years of bottling.

The success story of Baron Philippe de Rothschild has many chapters, and stretches from Bordeaux through southern France and California's Napa Valley to Chile. Along with the incomparable and inimitable Opus One, Château Mouton-Rothschild is certainly the Baron's most famous flagship. It is to the wine world what the Beatles are to pop music: a world-famous icon. The château is one of the five Premiers Grands Crus, Bordeaux's highest classification wineries. The expertise gained in Bordeaux has been successfully transformed over the years into the worldwide projects, each of which contributed its own part to the success story of the house.

Languedoc-Roussillon Red
Wine from the Languedoc-Roussillon region is produced in the South of France, ranging from the Mediterranean coast to Provence and is the biggest wine producing region in the world -- responsible for over 1/3 of France's wine production. Cabernet, Merlot, Mourvedre, Grenache, and Syrah are some of the most important red grapes in the region.  Most wine producers in this region produce blends, as opposed to single varietal wines. Although the region has been known to produce cheap table wine in the past, many vineyards and cooperatives are replacing lesser quality vines with higher quality wine varieties and production methods. The quality has been steadily improving since the 1970s when the region was best known for churning out cheap jug wine.  The two regions of Languedoc-Roussillon each produce distinct styles of red wine: The Languedoc is known for fruit-forward and full-bodied wines that can also be quite complex. Roussillon produces riper and juicier blends, as well as late-harvest and fortified wines.

BDX Wines
Les Grands Chais de France (GCF) is to launch a Merlot-based brand called BDX to make Bordeaux “more accessible and easier for wine drinkers to understand”. Due to be officially unveiled at the London Wine Fair, BDX is sealed with a screwcap, prominently features the term ‘claret’, and comes with “funky packaging”, according to GCF, the group behind JP Chenet, France’s best-selling wine brand. The Winery – which is also the largest independent supplier of French wines into the UK – adds that the new brand has been created “exclusively” for Britain’s on-trade and independent retailers. While Bordeaux is deemed to be too complicated for young people who are new to wine, the limited success of entry level ‘branded’ wines from the region, particularly in the UK, may have more to do with a feeling that the famous wine region’s price-quality ratio lags the competition from other parts of the wine world, as well as the sense that Bordeaux is not seen as ‘cool’ or ‘trendy’.

Bordeaux Red
Bordeaux has a cool marine coastal climate, with mild weather and no dry season. Bordeaux reds tend to be lower in alcohol and are slightly lighter in body. Bordeaux is the largest wine producing region in France. It consists of two major areas—the Left and the Right Bank. Both lie in the heart of the Gironde estuary and are further divided by its tributaries, the Garonne and the Dordogne rivers.  While the Right Bank produces blends that are mostly Merlot dominant, the Left Bank produces blends that are primarily Cabernet Sauvignon dominant.  Bordeaux reds are said to be terroir-driven. Terroir is a concise way to define a specific region based upon the soil, climate, and the collective knowledge of the generations of people who have farmed the land.  When shopping for Bordeaux reds, keep in mind, French wines are all about the region and the blend, not about individual grape varieties. While some of the most expensive wines in the world come from Bordeaux, most are every day, affordable table wines.

La Maison du Vigneron
La Maison du Vigneron relies on an obvious complementarity between traditional know-how and the dynamism of an organization that perfectly masters market developments. Since its creation, the Maison du Vigneron has developed a partnership with 100 winegrowers bringing grapes who work in close collaboration with teams of oenologists according to well-established specifications. This makes it possible to have traceability of the entire chain: upstream, with the winegrowers to ensure the rigorous selection of the grapes until the marketing of the products downstream with the objective of making Jura wines and crémants from quality. For the Maison du Vigneron, this is the number one priority. Thanks to a team of professionals endowed with long-standing know-how and state-of-the-art equipment, we ensure perfect monitoring of the vinification of wines and Crémants. Two stages are still essential to the birth of exceptional vintages: first, optimal quality of bottling, second, analysis and then tasting of the wines in a high-performance laboratory. The sum of all these actions allows the production of great wines that best express the qualities and character of the terroir.

There are a wide variety of styles to choose from, as Crémant is made in eight different appellations throughout France (and can also be found in neighboring Luxembourg). Crémant de Bordeaux: Primarily Merlot along with Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenère, Malbec, and Petit Verdot, Sauvignon Blanc, Sémillon and/or Muscadelle. In areas like Bordeaux, these wines are often overshadowed by the famous still red, white, and sweet white wines of the region. Crémant production from these appellations can be harder to find in export markets, but are certainly worth a sip if you do.

No summer afternoon is complete without a little bit of the pale pink/orange wines from Provence. These light and crisp roses have just the slightest touches of bright berry flavors and can complement a meal perfectly or be delightful on their own. The dry, refreshing, pink wines of Provence may not be complicated or heady, but they are certainly lovely. These brightly flavored, yet pale colored wines are full of crisp acidity with light touches of tart red berries and citrus fruit. These wines may not be serious, but you can't drink serious wines all of the time! Current trends are making these wines ridiculously popular, and for good reason. They are the perfect summer wine and can make any light afternoon meal even better with their liveliness and pretty fruit. These are much lighter than most California roses, but are typically much fresher and sharper.

Louis Latour
The Maison Louis Latour is one of the most famous names in Burgundy. Founded in 1797, the trading house has achieved worldwide fame in its 200-year history. The history of the Latour family actually began as a cooper. This is why the impressive main building still stands today in Rue des Tonnelliers, which is the 'Küfergasse' of Beaune. The main wine production is located in Savigny-les-Beaune. This is where the red Négoce wines and all white wines are produced. The house still operates its own cooperage. A small part of the perfectly processed 'pièces' is exported. Today, Latour's production includes almost all important Burgundy appellations. From the small Burgundy to the Côte Maconnais, Côte Chalonnais, all districts of the Côte d’Or and the Chablis under the name Simonnet-Febvre. The house Louis Latour in the Ardèche produces particularly interesting Chardonnays.

Burgundy White
White Burgundy is made from Chardonnay grown in the Burgundy region of France. The other principal grape grown in Burgundy is Pinot Noir. Burgundy has had a long love affair with wine, starting around the 1st century AD with the Romans. Later, the Cistercian monks really put Burgundy on the map by crafting wines for the local aristocracy. Widely viewed as the most terroir-driven of French wines, Burgundy wines, both red and white are made from varieties that easily reflect the soil and climate they are grown in. Like a blank canvas, Chardonnay readily expresses subtle variations from vineyards that are a mere stone's throw from one another, this is part of what makes Burgundy so compelling and so expensive. As with other regions in France, Burgundy can range in price from expensive to reasonably affordable. Burgundy's vineyard sites have been carefully divided over the centuries into Grand Cru, Premier Cru, village appellations and regional wines (aka Bourgogne blanc).

Southern Rhône Red
The Southern Rhône is situated in a large, sprawling valley, shaped by the course of the Rhône River. A Mediterranean climate makes the Southern Rhône Valley one of the warmest wine growing regions in France. Grape varieties that thrive in the region are well-suited to the hot, humid summers, and Grenache, Syrah, and Mourvèdre are by far the most common plantings. The vast majority of Rhône wines found on the market are labeled as Côtes du Rhône AOC (Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée). Many are excellent and inexpensive, making them one of the most consumer-friendly French wines to explore. Châteauneuf-du-Pape is one of the better-known sub-regions of the Southern Rhône, and while the wines can be somewhat expensive, the quality is generally exceptional. Grenache is by far the predominant grape found in Châteauneuf-du-Pape blends, and lends jammy red and black fruit notes along with flavors of earth, leather and spice and dried herbs.

Since it was not possible to find a description of the winery (or even the website), here is a description of the loire region: You won’t be bored when you visit the Loire River Valley. It’s one of France’s most beautiful and interesting wine regions. Lining a 300 mile east-to-west stretch of the country’s lengthiest river are 63 diverse wine districts for you to discover between tours of the pre-revolutionary French aristocracy’s jaw-dropping chateaux. There are three sections of the Loire whose different terroirs give rise to regional specialties, which are made into wines of every color and style (dry still red, white and rosé wines, sparkling and sweet). Most famous districts for whites are Sancerre and Pouilly in the east (Sauvignon Blanc), Vouvray and Savenniéres in the middle (Chenin Blanc), And the western Pays Nantais (Muscadet wines from Melon de Bourgogne). Centrally located Saumur is the core for sparkling Crémant de Loire. Red wines from Pinot Noir are produced in the east, but Cabernet Franc is the most common red variety used in the mid-regions’ Chinon still wines and the rosés of Anjou. Botrytized Chenin Blanc is responsible for the lauded sweet wine, Quarts de Chaume in the Coteaux-du-Layon.

Oster and wine go together – and have done so for 400 years. The journey from a small winery in Ediger on the Moselle river to a modern, state-of-the-art wine cellar that is part of a global network has been a long and successful one. The Vineyards is placed at so called "Trittenheimer Apotheke" In contrast to other famous slopes of the Moselle, the "Wehlener Sonnenuhr" or the "Bernkasteler Doctor", the history of the pharmacy does not go back too far. It did not come into fashion until after the Second World War, and from 1971, thanks to the new wine law, it was officially the most important location in the town, a bit more important than the "Trittenheim Altärchen". Much has been puzzled over the question of why the name "Apotheke", of all things, was able to establish itself. It is assumed that it has nothing to do with a drug store, but rather a corruption of the word "Abteiberg" or "Abtsberg".

Riesling is without question Germany's favorite grape. Widely planted, though once derided, Riesling is the superstar of the white wine world at the moment. There is a lot of scope for versatility with this sweet, viscous wine, though you can expect to get hints of tropical fruit, nectarine, melon and pineapple from a solid Riesling. The grape originated in the Rhine region of Germany, and the best of them are said to grow along the banks of the Mosel River on the beautiful steep, south facing hills. There are six categories of Riesling which indicate the ripeness of the grapes. Kabinett is considered “off-dry” and is a typically ripe grape. Spätlese is riper and therefor sweeter, and Auslese is even riper still. Beyond on that you have Beerenauslese, Trockenbeerenauslese and Eiswein (or ice wine), all getting sweeter, more viscous and more expensive.

The origins of the Metternich-Winneburg family estate at Schloss Johannisberg, or Fürst von Metternich Winneburg’sche Domäne Schloss Johannisberg – the first Riesling vineyard in the world – date back over 900 years. In 1775, late-harvest, or “Spätlese”, wine was discovered here, laying the foundation for future success. The Austrian Emperor conferred the estate upon Clemens Wenzel Fürst von Metternich in 1816 in recognition of his service in achieving European peace. In 1930, the prince granted the right to make Sekt from Schloss Johannisberg wines to producer Söhnlein Rheingold. Today, Fürst von Metternich is Germany’s market leading premium Sekt.

German Sparkling Wine
German sparkling wine was produced as early as 1826. And in 1872, 12 producers already participated in the Vienna World's Fair. At the beginning of the 20th century, 9 million bottles of German sparkling wine reached the market. Today - from over 1000 wineries and exported all over the world - there are probably around 500 million bottles. In the case of the cheap categories, the base wine is usually imported and processed into sparkling wine. The designation "Deutscher Sekt" guarantees what the name promises: the sparkling wine is made exclusively from grapes harvested in Germany. At the highest level is Deutscher Sekt b.A. It is made entirely from grapes harvested in a specific German growing region. All information such as area designation, grape variety, ripening period, alcohol content and vintage are precisely defined. Most sparkling wine will be produced via the Charmant method using most frequently the Riesling grape.

Raimund Prüm
Raimund Prüm, alias "the red Prüm", took over the winery from his early deceased father in 1971 and developed it into a top wine estate with an international reputation. Thus, the winery could grow to the stately size of 30ha, spread over steepest vineyards on Mosel, Saar and Ruwer, all planted with the best white wine grape variety Riesling. He transferred the winery to his daughter Saskia Andrea (S. A. Prüm). So that the noble Riesling wines show perfection in the glass,  they are stored in dark and cool vaulted cellar in old "Fuder barrels". These are the typical oak barrels of the region with a volume of 1,000 liters each. The oak was cut in local forests more than 60 years ago and offers perfect conditions for optimal storage. These barrels do not give any wood flavor to the wine, but shape the wine through micro-oxidation.

German Riesling
Riesling is without question Germany's favorite grape. Widely planted, though once derided, Riesling is the superstar of the white wine world at the moment. There is a lot of scope for versatility with this sweet, viscous wine, though you can expect to get hints of tropical fruit, nectarine, melon and pineapple from a solid Riesling. The grape originated in the Rhine region of Germany, and the best of them are said to grow along the banks of the Mosel River on the beautiful steep, south facing hills. There are six categories of Riesling which indicate the ripeness of the grapes. Kabinett is considered “off-dry” and is a typically ripe grape. Spätlese is riper and therefor sweeter, and Auslese is even riper still. Beyond on that you have Beerenauslese, Trockenbeerenauslese and Eiswein (or ice wine), all getting sweeter, more viscous and more expensive.

Salwey
The Salwey winery in Oberrotweil in the Kaiserstuhl is a winery and distillery in the German wine-growing region of Baden. The company has been family-owned since 1740, and the wines have been made there under the Salwey name for three generations. Mainly white grape varieties are grown on around 50 hectares of vineyards. The classic Kaiserstuhl grape varieties gray, white and pinot noir are cultivated there. With a share of 40 \% of the total vineyard area, the varieties Pinot Gris and Pinot Noir are the dominant grape varieties, while Pinot Blanc also has a significant share with 16 \%. The remaining 4 \% are divided between Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc. The winery produces dry wines without exception. Their character is determined solely by the variety and minerality of the volcanic terroir, to which spontaneous fermentation also contributes. The wines are largely matured in wooden barrels made from local oak and mature in their own mountain cellar, which is accessible from the tasting room at ground level. The wines are not bottled before May of the wine year.

German Red
It’s true. Germany is predominantly known for its outstanding white wine. But the quality of Red wine is also rising with each vintage. Red grapes now account for over a third of vineyard plantings in Germany, which might surprise those who automatically associate the country with its signature Riesling grape. That doesn’t mean that red wine is new to Germany, however. Some red grapes were documented in the country as far back as the 14th century. But whereas red German wine was historically a sweet wine, and more recently thought to be pale, thin, and acidic, today German reds can be complex, long-aging, and downright intense.

Schneider
A success from zero to one hundred. Or rather, one on 92 hectares. In 1994, Markus Schneider took over the manageable vineyard of his parents in Palatine Ellerstadt. Its yields were sold until then only as barrel-ware. With hard work, vision and ambition he went new ways. And the great success proves him right. The winery increasingly relied on wines based on red and white cuvees. Unusual was the varietal mix, which consisted not only of traditional Palatinate varieties such as Riesling, but also from international such as Sauvignon Blanc, Syrah and Merlot. "There was no life before the wine," says Markus Schneider. A motto that shows the uncompromising commitment with which the most famous German winegrower works. Markus Schneider became known for his red wine cuvée "Black Print". The uncomplicated, concise style of the wine convinces directly and immediately. The red wine has made the wine a brand and is probably THE most famous red of Germany.

Accademia die Racemi
Accademia dei Racemi is an organization which groups passionate viticulturists, agronomists and wine makers with the goal of promoting the production of quality wines made in Apulia. Among the duties there is also the one of selecting the most interesting and promising sites and vineyards of the region, involving their proprietors in this project while assisting them in the viticultural and wine making practices by offering the help of qualified wine makers and technicians. The work of Accademia dei Racemi is particularly focused on the local varieties, among them Primitivo, Negroamaro and Malvasia Nera, as well as less known varieties such as Susumaniello and Ottavianello, a variety known in France as Cinsaut.

Cantina Valpantena
Established by several Verona wine growers as a cooperative and now has approximately 250 members farms that cultivate a total of approximately 750 hectares of vineyards, all included in the controlled origin brand areas in the Verona hillsides territory. These members were joined, in July 2003 after merger with the ‘Oleificio delle Colline Veronesi’, by another 150 farmer producing olive oil. This gave live to a new oil and wine business in Valpantena. Products have achieved excellent levels of quality thanks to commitment and care lavished over the entire production cycle, where tradition and technological innovation blend together. The Valpantena Winery is able to fully exploit all the excellent qualities of the grapes and olives delivered by its members. Awards achieved in the most important national and international competitions are well-merited recognition of this effort at improving standards of production and quality.

Italian Amarone
Amarone della Valpolicella is a rich, dry Italian red wine from the Veneto region. It is produced primarily from the Corvina grape. Amarone is characterized by ripe, bold flavors.  Directly after harvest, the grapes are air dried through a process called “appassimento”, which allows them to shrivel into raisins. This concentrates the sugar and flavors in the grapes, producing a distinctive and full-bodied wine well-suited to aging.  It is often said that you can safely forget an Amarone in your wine cellar. Even average Amarones can be aged for 10-15 years. Depending on the vintage and aging technique, wines of exceptional quality can be enjoyed up to 30-50 years after bottling!  In wine, time equals money. The aging process, manual labor, and prime grape-growing real estate mean that Amarone is often quite expensive. Bottles of this iconic wine generally start at $50-$60, but the sky's the limit when it comes to price.  Despite its iconic status, Amarone only received DOCG recognition as recently as 2009.

Cantine Due Palme
The Due Palme wine cooperative was founded in 1989 and is now one of the largest cooperatives in southern Italy. It is located in the municipality of Cellino San Marco (Brindisi). This is located in the middle of the growing areas of the Salento peninsula in the southern Italian Apulia. Today Due Palme has more than 850 member winemakers who cultivate around 2000 hectares. They produce the traditional autochthonous grape varieties Negroamaro, Malvasia Nera, Primitivo and Susumaniello. In addition, international grape varieties such as Sangiovese, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Montepulciano and others are cultivated. 90% of the total production are red wines. The rapid rise, which was crowned "Best Winery in Italy" in 2009, is probably due to Angelo Maci, president and oenologist of the tightly managed company. The long-term contender for three glasses in the Italian wine guide Gambero Rosso is the Salice Salentino Rosso Riserva "Selvarossa".

Arguably more well known by its alter-ego Zinfandel, Primitivo is a huge, ripe Italian grape which is the pride of the Apulia region in the south of Italy. Primitivo is a delightfully brash wine that's very dark, very juicy and very high in alcohol. The grape is thought to have originated in Croatia, where it is known as Crljenak (shill-ee-ah-nock). It was then brought to Italy, and on to the United States in the 1800s, where it thrived under the Californian sun. Primitivos are very well known for being full-bodied fruit bombs. Much like Californian Zinfandels they have a very high alcohol content on account of the grapes ripening quickly. Primitivo is a fantastic BBQ wine. It loves pulled pork, ribs, steaks and anything with a lot of flavor and a mild char to it. Pizza is another excellent choice with this fabulous wine.

Puglia has a long tradition of pink wine production, a modern plethora of DOC, IGT and IGP denominations, and an eclectic range of grape varieties for rosato. It became the first Italian rosato to achieve international fame when, in 1943, the Leone de Castris family began selling their Salento-made pink wine to the American armed forces. They called the wine Five Roses for the benefit of their anglophone clients. Traditionally, rosato in the Salento area is made by drawing off a certain amount of liquid from a vat of red wine at the beginning of fermentation. This method involves 16-18 hours’ skin contact, and produces a more deeply coloured rosé with lots of fruit and, typically, a solid structure. Severino Garofano and Michele Calò are leading exponents of the style.

A beautiful, somewhat less popular, and often less expensive comparison to Champagne, Prosecco is a deliciously dry sparkling wine with crisp acidity, low sugar, with plenty of fruit and character. Associated with high value at low cost, Prosecco is the perfect option in situations where you want or need a sparkling wine. Traditionally from the Veneto (North Eastern Italy), Prosecco dons the name for a small village and is fermented almost solely from a grape called Glera. Most Prosecco is non vintage - which means it doesn't come with a year of production on the label. This wine is not made in the traditional method of “champagne making” with riddling, rebottling and such, which, combined with non vintage production, makes the wine more affordable than champagne. But do not worry, lb for lb (or dollar for dollar), Prosecco is often a far tastier option than the French sparkling alternative.

Italy is responsible for some of the finest wines in the world, and while Northern Italy receives the majority of the plaudits, there is some excellent wine emerging from the sparsely populated southern regions. Fiano and Greco are the two big white varietals in Campania and Basilicata, while Sicily has become known for their Bianco d'Alcamo, a dry wine made from the Marsala grape. Southern Italy's reputation has taken a beating in recent years as they have become known for producing bulk wine that they can't sell, and the reputation seems to endure despite some lovely wine coming from Sicily, Campania and Basilicata. Fiano tends to be a wonderfully creamy white wine with lots of green apple skin and pear. Greco, arguably Campania's flagship white grape, is a lot crisper, and typically has an abundance of minerality, lemon notes and pear.

The winery was founded in the 1930s. The goal from the beginning was to produce top wines with an unbeatable price-performance ratio. In the course of time, the winery bought vineyards in the best locations in various wine regions of Italy. In the meantime, Contri Spumanti has set itself the task of maintaining the age-old traditions of winemaking, although the winery is now one of the most innovative with the most modern technology in Italy. Contessa Carola is one of the Contri wineries in Apulia in the Manduria area with 50 year old vines, the wine yield is low, but the wine concentration is very high and noble. This gives this Primitivo a fine, concentrated taste. The region of Apulia with the capital Bari is the spur and boot heel of Italy. The name goes back to the Apuli, an Osker tribe. The area is one of the oldest wine-growing regions in the world, as the Phoenicians and the Greeks planted vines here as early as 3,000 years ago. The Romans continue the tradition and so Horace (65-8 BC) labeled the area as a place of "eternal spring".

Contessa Marina
The story of Contessa Marina begins with Count Bernardo - an unlucky cupbearer at the Pope's palace and his daughter Marina (derived from the Latin word Marinus, meaning "coming from the sea, belonging to the sea, living by the sea"). Bernardo had fallen out of favour at court because the wines he served were too light, bitter and discordant for the Pope. And so he sent his daughter to Apulia to find wines that would be more to the Pope's liking. Since then, the young Contessa has ridden through the country on a white horse, and word has quickly spread about her fine tongue, which can taste well and negotiate sharply. So only the best wines are offered to her. In the 1960s they co-founded the Cantolio cooperative winery to bring together the knowledge, combined forces and unique vineyards to produce authentic wine. These come from vines up to 70 years old, most of which are still grown in the traditional bush form, called Alberello.  And although the yields of the sometimes very old vines are low, the quality of the grapes is enormous and, accordingly, that of the wines.

Primitivo
Southern Italy Primitivo
Arguably more well known by its alter-ego Zinfandel, Primitivo is a huge, ripe Italian grape which is the pride of the Apulia region in the south of Italy. Primitivo is a delightfully brash wine that's very dark, very juicy and very high in alcohol. The grape is thought to have originated in Croatia, where it is known as Crljenak (shill-ee-ah-nock). It was then brought to Italy, and on to the United States in the 1800s, where it thrived under the Californian sun. Primitivos are very well known for being full-bodied fruit bombs. Much like Californian Zinfandels they have a very high alcohol content on account of the grapes ripening quickly. Primitivo is a fantastic BBQ wine. It loves pulled pork, ribs, steaks and anything with a lot of flavor and a mild char to it. Pizza is another excellent choice with this fabulous wine.

Contessa Marina
The story of Contessa Marina begins with Count Bernardo - an unlucky cupbearer at the Pope's palace and his daughter Marina (derived from the Latin word Marinus, meaning "coming from the sea, belonging to the sea, living by the sea"). Bernardo had fallen out of favour at court because the wines he served were too light, bitter and discordant for the Pope. And so he sent his daughter to Apulia to find wines that would be more to the Pope's liking. Since then, the young Contessa has ridden through the country on a white horse, and word has quickly spread about her fine tongue, which can taste well and negotiate sharply. So only the best wines are offered to her. In the 1960s they co-founded the Cantolio cooperative winery to bring together the knowledge, combined forces and unique vineyards to produce authentic wine. These come from vines up to 70 years old, most of which are still grown in the traditional bush form, called Alberello.  And although the yields of the sometimes very old vines are low, the quality of the grapes is enormous and, accordingly, that of the wines.

Southern Italy is the toe, heel, and ankle of the Italian “boot” where we find the regions Campania, Basilicata, Puglia, Calabria, and Sicily as well as the distant relative Sardegna. There are scores of fascinating indigenous grape varieties here, different winemaking traditions and styles are defining each region, and the wines are often less expensive than their Northern counterparts. Puglia and Sicily are producing huge volumes of wine, and they are battling to be the second biggest wine producing region in Italy. The hot climate is reflected in the wines and they are famous for their inexpensive, full bodied, warm, and fruit forward red wines based on Primitivo and Nero d’Avola. Less famous yet very interesting are the Sicilian wines from Mount Etna. The higher altitude yields wines that are lighter, fresh and complex.

Susumaniello is a little-known red-wine grape from Puglia, southern Italy. This ancient grape variety grows almost exclusively in the Salice Salento area and ranks among the world's rarest wine grapes. The classic red Susumaniello wine has a deep ruby hue and aromas of red berries and plums. Richer, more concentrated examples show spicy, peppery aromas and flavors of dark chocolate, resulting in really great red wines.

Southern Italy Rosato
Puglia has a long tradition of pink wine production, a modern plethora of DOC, IGT and IGP denominations, and an eclectic range of grape varieties for rosato. It became the first Italian rosato to achieve international fame when, in 1943, the Leone de Castris family began selling their Salento-made pink wine to the American armed forces. They called the wine Five Roses for the benefit of their anglophone clients. Traditionally, rosato in the Salento area is made by drawing off a certain amount of liquid from a vat of red wine at the beginning of fermentation. This method involves 16-18 hours’ skin contact, and produces a more deeply coloured rosé with lots of fruit and, typically, a solid structure. Severino Garofano and Michele Calò are leading exponents of the style.

The Al Dotto farm is an estate which extends on an area of 62 acres situated in Carignano, just North of Lucca, on slight hills, which formed the banks of a lake during the Paleozoic era. The vineyards are situated on gentle slopes with a splendid South-SouthWest exposure. The close proximity of the Serchio river, the influence of winds known as Scirocco, arriving from Livorno (South), and the summer Maestrale (NorthWest) winds, form a particular micro climate which guarantees to the grapes a good maturation taking advantage of the sensory characteristics of the wine.

Tuscan Red
After Piedmont and the Veneto, Tuscany produces the third highest volume of DOC/G quality wines. Tuscany is Italy's third most planted region (behind Sicily and Apulia) but it is eighth in production volume. This is partly because the soil of Tuscany is very poor, and producers emphasize low yields and higher quality levels in their wine. More than 80% of the regions' production is in red wine. The Sangiovese grape is Tuscany's most prominent grape. Cabernet Sauvignon has been planted in Tuscany for over 250 years, but has only recently become associated with the region due to the rise of the Super Tuscans. Other international varieties found in Tuscany include Cabernet franc, Chardonnay, Merlot, Pinot noir, Sauvignon blanc and Syrah. Of the many local red grape varieties Canaiolo, Colorino, Malvasia nera and Mammolo are the most widely planted. For Tuscan white wines, Trebbiano is the most widely planted variety followed by Malvasia, Vermentino and Vernaccia.

Italy, just like other wine countries of the world, has an interesting production of rose wines. From north to south, the choice of pink bottles is pretty vast and it is not difficult to find very good wines even in this category. Central-southern Italy is the area offering most of the production of rose wines, in particular Abruzzo with its Montepulciano d'Abruzzo Cerasuolo and Apulia with the roses of Salento. However even in the northern areas can be found good bottles, in particular near the lake of Garda and in the Alto Adige with the very good Lagrein Kretzer.

Central Italy White
The white wines that are made in Central Italy are not flashy or famous, but they can certainly be delicious. This area is known for making clean, light, white wines that are refreshing. Italian white wines can be very frustrating and confusing. They do not make many wines from grapes that most people are familiar with. However, some of the local grapes that are used can make wines that are elegant, refreshing, and fun. A lot of the really great white wines from Central Italy are going to be simple and light. They do not have a ton of strong fruit flavors, but can often produce subtly beautiful flavors of tart stone fruits, white flowers, and often almonds.

Paladin Vigne e Vini is the first winery of the whole Casa Paladin group, it’s a family owned estate founded by our father in 1962, in Motta di Livenza, near Treviso. It’s located at the boundaries of the Venetian land where we moved in the mid-70s, in Annone Veneto, a historic village located in the Roman Postumia road. The passion and love for vine and wine comes from our father, Valentino, who used to follow his grandfather, since he was a child, in the vineyards and in the cellar. Passion, research, dedication and respect for traditions are the main values that have been guiding his philosophy since he created his own cellar. He was strongly determined to enhance the territorial typicalness of our Lison-Pramaggiore area, by producing excellent wines.

The wines of Northern Italy include some of the most well known red wines in the country including Nebbiolo, Barbera, Dolcetto, Amarone and Valpolicella. Arguably, the two most important regions in Northern Italy are Piedmont in the northwest, and Veneto in the northeast. Red wines from these regions range from some of the most expensive and sought after in all of Italy to great value red wines. Nebbiolo produces some of the most exclusive and expensive red wines in Italy, including Barolo and Barbaresco. Dolcetto is planted on less desirable vineyard sites, and produces fruit-forward, great value wines that are meant to be consumed within 1-2 years of bottling. Barbera is a high yield variety with low tannins and high acidity. In Veneto, Valpolicella reigns supreme as its own distinct viticultural zone. There are five different tiers within this wine category ranging from inexpensive and light-bodied Valpolicella Classico, to pricey Amarone.

Over the years, Capofaro, has been added to the mother estate, Regaleali, in Salina, in the Aeolian archipelago. Tascante on Etna, the historic Whitaker estate on the ancient Mozia island, and Sallier de La Tour, in Monreale. In a precise project of valorization of the autochthonous varieties and of the territories with the highest wine-growing vocation. Next to the vineyards grow olive trees, wheat fields and almond trees. In the vegetable gardens, in the pastures, in the orchards, men and women work to help us keep pace with the seasons and give birth to the best products of Sicily. Each with its own character, each with its own rhythms. Today, for us the biggest challenge is to preserve these places and leave them intact to our children, in a sign of constant attention to the protection of every single ecosystem.

Southern Italy White
Italy is responsible for some of the finest wines in the world, and while Northern Italy receives the majority of the plaudits, there is some excellent wine emerging from the sparsely populated southern regions. Fiano and Greco are the two big white varietals in Campania and Basilicata, while Sicily has become known for their Bianco d'Alcamo, a dry wine made from the Marsala grape. Southern Italy's reputation has taken a beating in recent years as they have become known for producing bulk wine that they can't sell, and the reputation seems to endure despite some lovely wine coming from Sicily, Campania and Basilicata. Fiano tends to be a wonderfully creamy white wine with lots of green apple skin and pear. Greco, arguably Campania's flagship white grape, is a lot crisper, and typically has an abundance of minerality, lemon notes and pear.

Valdo
The history of Valdo winery began in 1926, when a group of four enterprising wine-makers from Valdobbiadene decided to join forces creating the Società Anonima Vini Superiori: a company principally devoted to sparkling wine production of Prosecco Superiore and Cartizze. The great step forward in terms of quality started in 1938 when the winery was bought by the renowned Bolla family from Verona and was renamed Valdo Spumanti in 1951. The name Valdo is immediately reminiscent of the Veneto region's Valdobbiadene hills, a Unesco World Heritage site producing the most elegant and refined Prosecco Superiore wines. These spectacular, incredibly steep slopes have century-old vineyards gifting us grapes that are entirely harvested by hand earning our grape growers the 'heroic viticulturists' reputation. Today Valdo operates in a perfect balance between tradition and innovation specializing in crafting high-quality, affordable luxury products including Prosecco Superiore DOCG, Prosecco DOC, sparkling Rosés and a special line of sparkling wines.

Italian Prosecco
A beautiful, somewhat less popular, and often less expensive comparison to Champagne, Prosecco is a deliciously dry sparkling wine with crisp acidity, low sugar, with plenty of fruit and character. Associated with high value at low cost, Prosecco is the perfect option in situations where you want or need a sparkling wine. Traditionally from the Veneto (North Eastern Italy), Prosecco dons the name for a small village and is fermented almost solely from a grape called Glera. Most Prosecco is non vintage - which means it doesn't come with a year of production on the label. This wine is not made in the traditional method of “champagne making” with riddling, rebottling and such, which, combined with non vintage production, makes the wine more affordable than champagne. But do not worry, lb for lb (or dollar for dollar), Prosecco is often a far tastier option than the French sparkling alternative.

Vigneti del Salento
The wines of the Vigneti del Salento come straight from sunny Apulia. The winery gets its name from the 100 kilometer long peninsula, which is probably better known as the "heel of the boot". The conditions here are perfect for growing sun-hungry grape varieties such as Primitivo, Negroamaro, Verdeca or Malvasia Nera and Bianco. Salento is also known as the first new home of the Primitivo, which stopped here for the first time on its triumphal march towards America. Just as Zinfandel belongs to California today like hardly any other grape variety, it is an integral part of the wine world of southern Italy under its original name Primitivo. Vigneti del Salento has the best prerequisites for excellent wines, especially since the winery can rely on the active support of the Italian wine heavyweight Farnese, who are at their side with know-how in the cellar and vineyard. The result is exceptionally great white and red wines from the classic grape varieties.

Primitivo
Southern Italy Primitivo
Arguably more well known by its alter-ego Zinfandel, Primitivo is a huge, ripe Italian grape which is the pride of the Apulia region in the south of Italy. Primitivo is a delightfully brash wine that's very dark, very juicy and very high in alcohol. The grape is thought to have originated in Croatia, where it is known as Crljenak (shill-ee-ah-nock). It was then brought to Italy, and on to the United States in the 1800s, where it thrived under the Californian sun. Primitivos are very well known for being full-bodied fruit bombs. Much like Californian Zinfandels they have a very high alcohol content on account of the grapes ripening quickly. Primitivo is a fantastic BBQ wine. It loves pulled pork, ribs, steaks and anything with a lot of flavor and a mild char to it. Pizza is another excellent choice with this fabulous wine.

Freixenet
The first bottle of Freixenet was released in 1914, the creation of a couple named Pedro Ferrer \& Dolores Sala who were both from winemaking families.  In 1889, Pedro Ferrer married Dolores Sala, whose family had been making wine at their Casa Sala property since 1861. Pedro’s nickname was “El Freixenet”, named after his family’s ranch “La Freixeneda”, which means ash tree grove in Catalan. Dolores’ keen interest in the winemaking process was easily complemented by Pedro’s business savvy and sense of community.  Their marriage coincided with the arrival of the Phylloxera plague in Spain, which wiped out most of Europe’s vineyards. Far from being deterred, the couple replanted their decimated land with white varietals to make sparkling wine. In 1914, the first bottles were released with Pedro’s childhood nickname on the label. Freixenet had been born.

Spanish Cava
In 1986, when Spain and Portugal joined the European Union,the EU pressured Spain to regulate Cava wine production, and thus a traditional area of production has been identified. Most Cava wine comes from the region of Penedès, in Catalonia - the “legal" Cava wine region is an area scattered almost all over Spain.  Cava is a Spanish sparkling wine made by a traditional method. It was formerly called Champaña, but in the Seventies it was rechristened “Cava" (Spanish for “cellar").  What most of us think we know about Cava - that it's the sparkling wine for which gyropallet was invented - is false. Cava is the first traditional-method sparkling wine documented to have undergone remuage using gyropallet, which - for the record - is a machine invented by two French wine producers. Winemakers in Champagne went on making remuage by hand, one bottle at a time, while the renowned Spanish Cava producer Codorníu introduced the innovation in his winemaking process, indissolubly binding the name of this system to the name of his wine.

Tres Reyes
The Bodegas Tres Reyes is linked to a project of various winemakers who are always looking for good locations with expressive wines. The company started around 25 years ago, and Pedro Huerta, a highly talented winemaker, has been part of the team since 2001. The avowed Tempranillo fan elicits new facets from Tempranillo with our Wine of the Year 2016 by marrying the traditional Spanish grape variety with the spicy Syrah. A gem that owes its power to the Castilian sun and the wonderful fruit aromas of the selected grape varieties. But it took a Pedro de Huerta to skilfully combine this into a Wine of the Year. The Tres Reyes wine family also includes a white wine made from Macabeo and Verdejo and another red wine, the Collección, with full 12 months in small wooden barrels ensure another leap in quality. All three wines give hope that the winemakers from Tres Reyes will continue to follow their motto: siempre buscando.

Spanish Red
The savory red wines of Spain are brooding and complex. They are typically a little lighter than a California Cabernet, but richer and fuller than a Pinot Noir. The most commonly used red grapes in Spain are the lovely Tempranillo grape and the rich Garnacha, but Cabernet Sauvignon is starting to get popular as well. The main grape in Spain is Tempranillo, which is followed closely by Garnacha. In the past, Spanish reds were know to be worthy of aging for decades and were very expensive because of this. Now that technology is more available they are making more affordable, fruitier wines. The most famous red wine in Spain is Rioja and it is made from the Tempranillo grape. Rioja is usually very complex and savory. Another famous wine is Priorat which is made largely from Garnacha and lush with dark fruit, spice, and vanilla. Sometimes Rioja and Priorat wines can be very pricey due to their long aging, but often those same wineries make much more affordable wines that are aged for less time, but are still delicious!
